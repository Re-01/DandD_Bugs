Welcome to Drag and Drop Puzzle Game!

This project was created in 2019, during Media Authoring Class and we really hope this could be funny for you.

First of all, you will need a good computer and internet as well. So, open the game and choose one of the four options of pictures.
When you choose one of them, just grab and hold one piece of chart until the right board, and then place it.

Continuing doing that until complete all of the four pieces and see the image formed. If the image is not right, you will need to try many times that you need. See the right picture formed as soon you finish and go the another picture.

Remember to invite your friends to having fun with this game too.

Enjoy!!
